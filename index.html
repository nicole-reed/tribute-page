        On June 18, 1983, NASA astronaut Sally Ride became the first U.S. woman in space when she launched on the STS-7 mission of the space shuttle Challenger. She was the third woman in space, after Valentina Tereshkova and Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who flew on the Soyuz T-7 mission on Aug. 19, 1982.

      <P>Born in Encino, California, Ride studied physics and English at Stanford University, ultimately earning a Ph.D. physics in 1973. She joined NASA's astronaut corps in 1978 as one of the first six female astronauts to join the U.S. space agency.

      Ride was 32 when the STS-7 mission launched into space. The mission was NASA's seventh shuttle flight and marked the first time a woman controlled a space shuttle robotic arm. STS-7's main mission was deploy communications satellites for Canada and Indonesia. Challenger returned to Earth with Ride and her STS-7 crewmates on June 24, wrapping up a six-day flight.

      Ride would make history again in 1984 when she launched on the Challenger's STS-41G mission, beginning the first American woman to fly in space twice. In 2012, Ride died from cancer at age 61.
